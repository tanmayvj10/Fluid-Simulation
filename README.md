# Fluid-Simulation
This project is a pure Java-based physics simulation that models fluid and rigid body interactions using fundamental principles of particle physics, collisions, and gravity—all without relying on external libraries. The simulation represents particles as discrete entities, each obeying Newtonian mechanics, enabling realistic interactions such as:
- Elastic & inelastic collisions between particles
- Gravity-driven motion and free-fall dynamics
- Rigid body constraints to simulate solid-like behavior
- Basic fluid-like motion for soft body interactions
